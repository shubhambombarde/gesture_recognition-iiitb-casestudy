NOTE:
In this repo, Gesture_Recognition_JarvisLabs.ipynb is derived from the started file present on JarvisLabs instance.
Neural_Nets_Project_Starter_Code.ipynb is downloaded from UpGrad portal, where I think the lobraries used are old.
Hence I have started working on file Gesture_Recognition_JarvisLabs.ipynb
